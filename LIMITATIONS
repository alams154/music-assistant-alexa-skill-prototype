Supported Region and Language:
Currently, only en-US is supported by this prototype.

Supported Devices (Tested):

Technical Limitations:
Non-APL devices require proxied, internet accessible https endpoints for media streaming.

All devices have a delay with pausing, this is due to the AlexaPy library.
