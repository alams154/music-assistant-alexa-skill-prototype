# Disclaimer

This project is a prototype Alexa skill integration for the Music Assistant server. It is provided "as is" for experimentation, development, and demonstration purposes only.

A significant portion of the code is developed using LLMs and may not adhere to best practices or be production-ready. The code may contain bugs, security vulnerabilities, or performance issues.

If you do find any security vulnerabilities, please open an issue in the repository or report a vulnerability in the security tab. I will do my best to address it as soon as possible.

As the project is still in beta, there may be breaking changes in an update. Please manually keep track of releases and revert to a previous version if you encounter any issues.

I am not currently following proper commit messaging conventions and will adopt a more structured approach after exiting this beta stage.
